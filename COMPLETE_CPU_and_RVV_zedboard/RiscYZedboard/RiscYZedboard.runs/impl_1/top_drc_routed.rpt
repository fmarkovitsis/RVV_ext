REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 ppu_inst/sprite_BRAM/mem_reg has an input control pin ppu_inst/sprite_BRAM/mem_reg/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: ppu_inst/sprite_BRAM/Q[7]) which is driven by a register (ppu_inst/text_address_reg[8]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

REQP-1840#18 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 ppu_inst/attributes_Buffer/mem_reg has an input control pin ppu_inst/attributes_Buffer/mem_reg/ADDRBWRADDR[8] (net: ppu_inst/attributes_Buffer/ADDRBWRADDR[5]) which is driven by a register (HSYNC/haddr_reg[3]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 ppu_inst/attributes_Buffer/mem_reg has an input control pin ppu_inst/attributes_Buffer/mem_reg/ADDRBWRADDR[9] (net: ppu_inst/attributes_Buffer/ADDRBWRADDR[6]) which is driven by a register (VSYNC/vaddr_reg[5]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
